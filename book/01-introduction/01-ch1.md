# On code snippets, following along at home, and how to read the book

This book should be valuable if you halfassedly skim the code snippets.

Some of you may opt to start a fresh repo and copy over certain snippets and fill in the gaps yourself, really treat it as a textbook. That should go pretty well. 

Others will look at the book repo and poke it. If you clone it and open up claude code, you can "chat with the repo". Ask claude to give you exercises by breaking it so you can fix it. If you interact with the book code in this way, do fork it so you can send me PRs with any errors you find.
