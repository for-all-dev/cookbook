# On code snippets, following along at home, and how to read the book

This book should be valuable if you halfassedly skim the code snippets.

Some of you may opt to start a fresh repo and copy over certain snippets and fill in the gaps yourself, really treat it as a textbook. That should go pretty well. 

Others will look at the book repo and poke it. If you clone it and open up claude code, you can "chat with the repo". Ask claude to give you exercises by breaking it so you can fix it. If you interact with the book code in this way, do fork it so you can send me PRs with any errors you find.

## Installation

If you're not using `uv` yet: it's the correct way to interact with python in year of our lord. [Install it](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/). No, I don't care if you want to follow along with requirements.txt or poetry. It's year of our lord, we don't do that anymore. 

You'll need to install `dafny` and `elan` (the Lean toolchain manager). In principle I could've dockerized so you wouldn't need to, but that would've made the tutorial code a hair more complicated. So we're going to rely on local installs.

[`elan`](https://github.com/leanprover/elan#installation) is very nice to use, especially if you're used to Rocq. It's inspired by the rust ecosystem's `rustup`, much of its API/CLI is the same. Similarly, `lake` is Lean's `cargo`.

[`dafny`](https://dafny.org/) is a part of the dotnet ecosystem, but seems to install pretty easily via your operating system's package index.
