# Structure of the book

We're going to be working with Dafny and Lean. You don't need to know much about Dafny or Lean in particular to read this. There will be short sections introducing the languages in the appropriate places, which are easy to skip[^1].

[^1]: I honestly had the language model write them, but I'll styletransfer them to some fun literary voices, just to spice things up.
