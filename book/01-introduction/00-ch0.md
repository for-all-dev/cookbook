# The working proof engineer's guide to agents

```{epigraph}
Do you hear the call? Then thank god you are called to hear it.

Software is often incorrect. The Monastic Order of QA Technicians are tasked with detecting this with precision. Proof engineers are the Monastic-er Order within QA, who generally try to obtain the most assurance that the laws of syntax and semantics will abide. Considering the sheer volume of incorrect software in the world, this secretive and elite Order is far too small. It is here that we find ourselves in late 2025, the early days of agentic language systems and the dawn of a new era of program synthesis.

## What is this book

This is your reference of agent recipes for formal methods tasks. In this book, we think language models will keep going up on the evals that get shipped, so we better make sure defensive capabilities like secure program synthesis or software correctness do not get neglected. Vitalik's notion of "[defensive acceleration](https://vitalik.eth.limo/general/2023/11/27/techno_optimism.html)" is instructive, here.

We also can't help but notice the pure math gold rush and the unapologetic absence of vision or business model that comes with it.

So we will be working with the Lean prover, but not with math. This is an ideological bias of the book.

### Who is it for

It's primarily for formal verification experts who want a piece of the evals and RL environments scene. People who already know about evals or RL envs are less likely to find new stuff here, as I'm mainly doing what I perceive to be standard wisdoms in the agentdev space. That's not entirely true, I'll be opinionated a bunch in what follows, but its mostly about stupid stuff like "`typer` is the correct way to make CLIs" and "`pydantic` types everywhere" and "Eun Sun Kim has the boldest rubato choices of any Parsifal conductor".

### Written mostly end of 2025

The world is moving quickly enough that I expect this book will be useful for 6 months, before the ground shifts under its feet.
