# Running the Plain Implementation

Now that we've seen how the plain Python agent works, let's run it. The agent is exposed as a command-line interface, which you can run with `uv run agent dafnybench plain`. ## TODO: audit the prose to make sure its not too LLMy

The CLI accepts two arguments: `--model` and `--limit`. The `--model` argument lets you specify which Anthropic model to use, and the `--limit` argument lets you limit the number of samples to evaluate.

```bash
# Test with 1 sample
uv run agent dafnybench plain --limit 1

# Full evaluation
uv run agent dafnybench plain

# Different model
uv run agent dafnybench plain -m anthropic/claude-3-opus-20240229
```

The agent will create a log file in the `logs` directory, with a name like `plain_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.log`. This file contains a detailed record of the agent's execution, including all the messages exchanged with the model.

The agent also creates artifacts in the `artifacts` directory. For each attempt, it saves the Dafny code to a file named `sample_<id>_attempt_<n>.dfy`. When the agent successfully verifies a sample, it saves the final code to `sample_<id>_final.dfy`. These artifacts are invaluable for debugging the agent and understanding its behavior.

By inspecting the logs and artifacts, you can get a very clear picture of how the agent is thinking and how it's using the tools to solve the DafnyBench problems.
