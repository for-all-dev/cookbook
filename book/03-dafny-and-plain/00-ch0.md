# DafnyBench with plain Python

To dispel superstition about elaborate frameworks like `inspect-ai`, we're also going to walk through the same task with plain Python and the Anthropic SDK.

TODO

### Notes:
- use a `config.toml` for prompt config (and other aspects of config)
- talk about persisting data, maybe have option to persist history
- Talk about how you currently think the recommendation is to use plain Python if you'll live with a codebase for more than 3 months. (especially now that anthropic's structured outputs feature is so much better)
