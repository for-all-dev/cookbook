# DafnyBench with plain Python

To dispel superstition about elaborate frameworks like `inspect-ai`, we're also going to walk through the same task with plain Python and the Anthropic SDK.

While frameworks like `inspect-ai` can be great for getting started, there's a strong case to be made for using plain Python for agent development, especially for projects you intend to maintain for more than a few months. As language models and their APIs evolve, the abstractions provided by frameworks can sometimes become leaky or outdated. Working directly with the Anthropic SDK (or any other model provider's library) gives you maximum flexibility and control.

This is especially true as features like structured outputs become more reliable. The ability to get well-formed JSON or other structured data directly from the model reduces the need for complex parsing and extraction logic, which is often a key feature of agent frameworks.

In this chapter, we'll build a Dafny agent from scratch using plain Python. We'll also discuss practical considerations like persisting conversation history, which is crucial for debugging, evaluation, and potentially for fine-tuning models in the future.
