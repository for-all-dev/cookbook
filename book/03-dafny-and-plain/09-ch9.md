# Conclusion

My all-things-considered recommendation, both from talking to people and living my life, is that if you're going to be in a codebase for longer than about 3 months you should roll your own agent development abstractions with plain Python. Frameworks are amazing for quick projects and exploration, but start to get on your nerves if you're doing something seriously custom. Unless you're like the platonic ideal of the `inspect-ai` user, though I don't think formal methods evals really are. `pydantic-ai` has an even less academic primary usecase, so is probably even less appropriate.

## Exercises

- Go back to `inspect` codebase with the part from this chapter about inserting with a diff rather than regenerating a whole file and adjust it to that.
