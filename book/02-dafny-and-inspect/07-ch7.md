# Up next: hint insertions without a framework

We didn't actually do the task right. DafnyBench proper leaves the source of each sample mostly hardcoded, and only inserts hints. Instead, we had it regenerate _all_ the code in the completion because that is the simplest text-to-text setup.

This is of course acceptable when you trust the language model, which you don't.
