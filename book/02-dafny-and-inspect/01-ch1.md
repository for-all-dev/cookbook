# Dafny

Dafny was created by Rustan Leino at Microsoft Research, first appearing around 2009. It's built on top of Boogie, an intermediate verification language also developed at MSR, which in turn uses SMT solvers (primarily Z3) as its backend proof engine. This architecture means Dafny programs get compiled to Boogie's intermediate representation, which then generates verification conditions that Z3 attempts to prove automatically.

The language integrates with the .NET ecosystem—it can compile to C#, and there's even a Visual Studio extension for development. But Dafny's extraction abilities go beyond .NET: it can compile verified code to multiple targets including C#, Java, JavaScript, Go, and Python. This means you can write and verify your program once in Dafny, prove it correct, and then extract it to production code in your target language with confidence that the verification guarantees carry through.

Real-world usage has been somewhat limited but notable. Amazon Web Services used Dafny to verify components of their S3 encryption client, and Microsoft has used it internally for verification tasks. The Dafny community remains active in academia for teaching formal methods and in research for exploring program verification techniques. More recently, with the rise of LLM-based code generation, Dafny has found new relevance as a target for verified code synthesis—which is exactly what we're doing with DafnyBench.
