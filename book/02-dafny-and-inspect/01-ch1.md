# Dafny

Dafny was created by Rustan Leino at Microsoft Research, first appearing around 2009. It's built on top of [Boogie](todo: link), an intermediate verification language also developed at MSR, which in turn uses SMT solvers (primarily Z3) as its backend proof engine. This architecture means Dafny programs get compiled to Boogie's intermediate representation, which then generates verification conditions that Z3 attempts to prove automatically.

The language integrates with the .NET ecosystem—it can compile to C#, and there's even a Visual Studio extension for development. Dafny also extracts verified code to multiple targets including C#, Java, JavaScript, Go, and Python. This means you can write and verify your program once in Dafny, prove it correct, and then extract it to production code in your target language and believe that the guarantees are preserved. 

Real-world usage has been somewhat limited but notable. [AWS used Dafny to verify components of their S3 encryption client](TODO: link), and Microsoft has [used it internally](TODO: evidence) for verification tasks. Everyone is saying the [new Dafny textbook](todo: link) is really good for bringing people into formal methods, but I haven't looked at it yet. Recently, Dafny has been a target for verified code synthesis, a la DafnyBench and other papers.
