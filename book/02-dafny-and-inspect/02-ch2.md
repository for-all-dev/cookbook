# Running inspect

At this point, we can run with `uv run agent dafny --framework inspect`. There's some `typer` code for the actual CLI but that's not important. You can read it in the repo if you care.

Inspect has a TUI, but instead we're going to open up a new terminal and type `uv run inspect view` for their webapp logviewer. More likely, I'm going to, and you'll just follow along via screenshot.
