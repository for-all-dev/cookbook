# Dafny and DafnyBench
```{epigraph}

In the world-breath's wafting universe to drown, to sink

-- Isolde, *Tristan und Isolde*, Act III Scene 3

In this chapter, we're going to ship a solver for [DafnyBench (Sun et al 2024)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03178). Dafny is a verification-aware programming language developed at Microsoft Research that allows you to write programs alongside formal specifications and proofs of correctness—the Dafny compiler won't let you compile code unless you've proven it meets its spec. DafnyBench is a dataset of 750 Dafny program repair tasks, where each task provides a buggy program and specification, and the goal is to fix the code so it verifies.

The [UK AISI](https://www.aisi.gov.uk/) incubated an evals framework called [`inspect_ai`](https://inspect.ai-safety-institute.org.uk/), though it is [currently not being maintained by the AISI](https://manifund.org/projects/inspect-evals).
