# DafnyBench returns

[Webster's dictionary](https://www.merriam-webster.com/slang/rawdog) defines rawdogging as doing something hard or boring without any aid, preparation, or diversions. Just to dispell superstition about elaborate frameworks like inspect, we're also going to walk through with pure python and the Anthropic SDK.

TODO

### Notes:
- use a `config.toml` for prompt config (and other aspects of config)
- talk about persisting data, maybe have option to persist history
- Talk about how you currently think the current is to rawdog if you'll live with a codebase for more than 3 months. (especially now that anthropic's structured outputs feature is so much better)
- exercise: go back to `inspect` codebase with the part from this chapter about inserting with a diff rather than regenerating a whole file and adjust it to that.
